In 1924 Scientific American’s pages were bemoaning traffic, waste management and pests. They were also praising the by-products of coal tar and those substances’ use in household items. While the record is clear on the toxicity of fossil fuels to our environment and our health, demand for fossil-fuel-based “petrochemical” products such as plastic is only increasing. Host Rachel Feltman advises on how to avoid petrochemicals in our everyday products. Plus, we take a lighthearted look at a telepathy study also featured in one of our 1924 issues. &#10;&#10;Recommended reading:&#10;The Gas Industry Is Gaslighting the Public about Climate Change&#10;Renewable Power Set to Surpass Coal Globally by 2025&#10;&#10;E-mail us at sciencequickly@sciam.com if you have any questions, comments or ideas for stories we should cover!&#10;Discover something new every day: subscribe to Scientific American and sign up for Today in Science, our daily newsletter. &#10;Science Quickly is produced by Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Madison Goldberg and Jeff DelViscio.
