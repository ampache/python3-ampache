While you can get BV without ever having sex, a new study has found that, in some cases, it could be functioning more like a sexually transmitted infection. That&amp;rsquo;s in part because of the increased risk of BV after sex with a new partner and a high recurrence of BV symptoms after treatment.The study examined women with BV who were in a monogamous relationship with a male partner and found that treating both people was significantly more effective than treating the woman alone. Host Rachel Feltman speaks with study co-authors Lenka Vodstrcil, a senior research fellow at Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University in Australia, and Catriona Bradshaw, a professor of sexual health medicine at Monash University and Australia&amp;rsquo;s Alfred Hospital.&#10;&#10;Recommended reading:&#10;Read the study&#10;Resources for patients and health professionals&amp;nbsp;&#10;&#10;E-mail us at sciencequickly@sciam.com if you have any questions, comments or ideas for stories we should cover!&#10;&#10;Discover something new every day: subscribe to Scientific American and sign up for Today in Science, our daily newsletter.&amp;nbsp;&#10;&#10;Science Quickly is produced by Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Naeem Amarsy and Jeff DelViscio.

Straddling the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic regions, it&amp;rsquo;s part of&amp;nbsp;a climate change hot spot. Some of the biggest fuels are shrubs. One&amp;nbsp;study&amp;nbsp;found that shrubland covers 1.6 million hectares in Portugal&amp;mdash;about 18 percent of the nation&amp;rsquo;s land area. And those shrubs are gaining ground. That&amp;rsquo;s because, for decades, people have been moving out of rural communities such as the one Tommy Ferreira lives in. Most leave to pursue better-paying jobs in the cities or in wealthier European Union countries. Portugal has lost 30 percent of its rural population since 1960. The same trend is occurring across the Mediterranean region. Abandoning these farmlands is increasing wildfire risk, according to an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development report released last spring. When people who work the land leave it, grazing pastures and farm fields become thick with fuels. But these ancient Maronesa cattle can help solve both of these modern-day problems.
