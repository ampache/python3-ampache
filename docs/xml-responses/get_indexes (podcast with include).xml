      <description><![CDATA[Protests around the construction of the now complete Dakota Access Pipeline brought national attention to Energy Transfer, the company that built and owns the pipeline and funded private security against the protestors. Energy Transfer sued the nonprofit Greenpeace for hundreds of millions of dollars. The company claimed that the Standing Rock movement was not Indigenous-led environmental activism but a conspiratorial effort by Greenpeace. Reporter Alleen Brown is spending this season of her podcast, Drilled, looking into the lawsuit and the message that legal actions like this send to activists.&nbsp;

      <description><![CDATA[Creating a bird flu vaccine requires several layers of bioprotective clothing and typically a whole lot of eggs. H5N1 avian influenza infections have gone from flocks of chickens to herds of cattle and humans. Scientists at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute are taking their best guess at the strains of the virus that could spread and are creating critical vaccine candidates.

Multimedia journalist and Scientific American multimedia intern Naeem Amarsy suited up and went to San Antonio, Tex., to visit a &ldquo;biosafety level three&rdquo; (BSL-3) lab at the institute.&nbsp;

This is the third and final episode of our series about bird flu.

      <description><![CDATA[Dairy cattle have become an intermediary between avian influenza found in wild birds and the handful of recorded H5N1 bird flu cases in humans. Senior news reporter Meghan Bartels took a trip upstate to Cornell University&rsquo;s Teaching Dairy Barn. Early last year Texas dairy farmers noticed lethargic cows producing off-color milk. One of them sent Cornell researchers a sample, which genetic sequencing determined to contain a strain of H5N1. That strain traces its roots to the H5N1 virus that emerged in China in the late 1990s&mdash;which spread around the world thanks to migrating wild birds, such as those found on the beach that associate health and medicine editor Lauren Young visited in episode one of our three-part series about bird flu. And outbreak of H5N1 has been running through poultry farms since the early 2020s. Poultry farmers have been forced to cull flocks, reinforce biosecurity protocols and change the prices of eggs as a result. Dairy farms were less prepared for the spillover and its unexpected transition into raw-milk-drinking barn cats. While pasteurization makes milk safe for human consumption, there&rsquo;s no easy way to prevent the spread between herds of cattle. In the next episode, multimedia intern and producer Naeem Amarsy looks at how the virus made yet another hop&mdash;this time into humans.

      <description><![CDATA[Bird flu outbreaks in poultry and cattle have caused concern for public health officials. There have been few reported cases of human transmission, but the growing risks of H5N1 avian influenza have virologists on alert.



Researchers at the St. Jude Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response take an annual visit to Delaware Bay to collect samples of bird poop for analysis. These samples give the researchers a look at emerging avian illnesses. While spillover of H5N1 into domestic birds has been known for a while, the first case of spillover into humans was only identified during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. Since then H5N1 has gone global and moved from transmitting from bird to bird to spreading from bird to mammal and from mammal to mammal.



Associate health and medicine editor Lauren Young takes a sample collection walk on the beach and speaks with virus detectives about how H5N1 evolved in episode one of our three-part series about bird flu.

Join us on Wednesday to learn how bird flu jumped from poultry to cattle.

      <description><![CDATA[Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is exploding in popularity among men. TRT has been touted online as a cure-all for everything from low energy to poor mood and even as a way to increase masculinity itself. But how much of the buzz is backed by science? Host Rachel Feltman talks with journalist Stephanie Pappas about the realities behind the trend. They explore who truly benefits from TRT, the overlooked risks&mdash;including fertility loss&mdash;and the rise of private clinics offering testosterone.

      <description><![CDATA[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has fired the experts on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s vaccine advisory panel, sparking concern among public health officials. Ocean acidification has crossed a critical threshold, posing serious risks to marine life around the globe. And pangolins face growing threats from increased hunting, complicating efforts to protect the world&rsquo;s most trafficked mammal.

      <description><![CDATA[Most mammalian dads are pretty absent from their offspring&rsquo;s lives. That sets the Djungarian hamster apart from its fellow fathers. These hamster dads are involved in the birth of their pups, care for them in infancy and even provide food during weaning. They also let the mother hamster go on cooldown walks outside of the burrow, which professor of veterinary medicine and hamster expert Katherine Wynne-Edwards thinks could be essential to the survival of the species in its superharsh environment. But there&rsquo;s also some familiar mate selection at play: female Djungarian hamsters choose to mate with males who will provide quality parental care.

      <description><![CDATA[Animals&rsquo; lifespans can be far shorter or much longer than those of humans. Scientists are researching creatures such as &ldquo;immortal&rdquo; jellyfish and long-lived tortoises and digging deep into genetic codes to figure out why animals age&mdash;and what we can do to improve longevity in humans. Jo&atilde;o Pedro de Magalh&atilde;es, chair of molecular biogerontology at the University of Birmingham in England, lays out the state of aging science.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <description><![CDATA[New simulations suggest the Milky Way&rsquo;s long-predicted collision with Andromeda might be less of a cosmic certainty than we thought. A massive marine heat wave in 2023 sent North Atlantic temperatures soaring&mdash;equal to two decades&rsquo; worth of typical warming&mdash;with weak winds and climate change largely to blame. And researchers reveal that the planet&rsquo;s most abundant animals&mdash;nematodes&mdash;may use teamwork and tower-building to hitch rides to new homes.

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions,&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy&quot;&gt;according to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent.&rdquo; Wikipedia should know all about stigmergy, since it&rsquo;s almost a perfect description of how Wikipedia itself is made. While this model of collaboration is most commonly associated with ants, not global knowledge sharing, we&rsquo;ll explore both and how they&rsquo;ve shaped our world through asynchronous collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us as we talk to Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation (the nonprofit organization that runs Wikipedia), and Clint Penick, an ant researcher and assistant research professor in the Biomimicry Center at Arizona State University.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;On our first episode, we look at how collaboration happens in one of comedy&#039;s most storied (and tough) environments &mdash; the TV writers&#039; room. It&#039;s where the magic happens, but it can also be one of the most brutally competitive places a creative person will ever work. We talk to two writer-comedians, Anne Lane and Wayne Federman, about their experiences working in writers&#039; rooms on shows like &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
