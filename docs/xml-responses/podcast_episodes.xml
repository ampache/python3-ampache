    <description><![CDATA[Science journalist and Radiolab host Latif Nasser found himself at the center of a space mystery. A space poster in his child&rsquo;s room showed Zoozve, a moon circling Venus. Only Nasser had never heard of Zoozve&mdash;and neither had anyone else. Nasser brings us the story of Zoozve the quasi-moon and brings listeners the opportunity to name a quasi-moon of their own.

    <description><![CDATA[We&rsquo;re at the end of the Nathaniel B. Palmer&rsquo;s Antarctic expedition. The researchers onboard are returning sea ice and thousands of gallons of seawater. These samples will allow them to examine biogeochemical processes, some of which are linked to climate change. As the research vessel makes its way back to port, the scientists reflect on the future of our planet and the question of whether the ice in Antarctica will always be around for sampling.
