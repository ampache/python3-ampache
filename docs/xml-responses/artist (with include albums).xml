    <summary><![CDATA[. Born in 2000 at Lisbon - Portugal, Structura is a sound exploration project using as main tools electronic composition, frequency modulation and effects, the cut-up (of texts), spoken word, DJing, samples, video and others.
Structura works sounds normally associated with experimental electronica currents like Rhythmic-Noise, Power-Electronics, Break'n'Noise, IDM, Spoken-Word but freelly enough not to get to attached to them.
The sound compositions in Structura are linked to concepts, images, literature, cinema and other arts.
