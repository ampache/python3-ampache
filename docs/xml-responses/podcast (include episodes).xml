      <description><![CDATA[Science journalist and Radiolab host Latif Nasser found himself at the center of a space mystery. A space poster in his child&rsquo;s room showed Zoozve, a moon circling Venus. Only Nasser had never heard of Zoozve&mdash;and neither had anyone else. Nasser brings us the story of Zoozve the quasi-moon and brings listeners the opportunity to name a quasi-moon of their own.

      <description><![CDATA[We&rsquo;re at the end of the Nathaniel B. Palmer&rsquo;s Antarctic expedition. The researchers onboard are returning sea ice and thousands of gallons of seawater. These samples will allow them to examine biogeochemical processes, some of which are linked to climate change. As the research vessel makes its way back to port, the scientists reflect on the future of our planet and the question of whether the ice in Antarctica will always be around for sampling.

      <description><![CDATA[Przewalski&rsquo;s horses are truly wild horses, even the ones held in captivity. They traditionally roamed the Central Asian steppes, so you can imagine everyone&rsquo;s surprise when two separate accounts on TikTok claimed to have found a Przewalski&rsquo;s horse here in the U.S. But as guest and Scientific American associate news editor Allison Parshall will tell you, the real story is the remarkable conservation efforts that led to a resurgence for this horse, which was once considered extinct in the wild.

      <description><![CDATA[We&rsquo;re looking at our reporting&mdash;from 100 years ago. In 1924 Scientific American&rsquo;s pages were bemoaning traffic, waste management and pests. They were also praising the by-products of coal tar and those substances&rsquo; use in household items. While the record is clear on the toxicity of fossil fuels to our environment and our health, demand for fossil-fuel-based &ldquo;petrochemical&rdquo; products such as plastic is only increasing. Host Rachel Feltman advises on how to avoid petrochemicals in our everyday products. Plus, we take a lighthearted look at a telepathy study also featured in one of our 1924 issues.&nbsp;

      <description><![CDATA[The Supreme Court dismissed a case about Idaho&rsquo;s abortion ban, preserving a lower court ruling that allows for emergency access to abortion in the state. NASA pushed back a return flight for two Starliner astronauts so that Boeing and the agency can better understand the helium leaks and thruster failures that plagued the spacecraft&rsquo;s launch.&nbsp;

Infectious disease experts are still tracking the transmission of bird flu in the U.S., while Finland is set to offer preemptive vaccines to farmworkers. Higher temperatures are contributing to a spike in dengue fever. A new strain of mpox is spreading in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

      <description><![CDATA[Life onboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer can be cramped and cold.

Research, routine and a mock trial with the god of the sea help these scientists stay grounded.
Stay tuned for the fourth and final episode of this Friday Fascination: researchers reflect on the emotional toll of witnessing climate change&rsquo;s impact on Antarctica.

      <description><![CDATA[Summers are getting hotter, with heat waves that last longer and occur more often. That makes it even more important to communicate the risks of heat to vulnerable groups and keep communities and individuals cool. Sustainability editor Andrea Thompson explains why it feels hotter than ever and how to keep yourself and your community safe in the summer heat.&nbsp;

      <description><![CDATA[Microplastics are everywhere&mdash;and we mean everywhere. These pesky plastic pollutants have been found in penis tissue, testicles, breast milk and blood. They&rsquo;ve turned up in Antarctic snow, in the clouds above Mount Fuji, inside deep-sea creatures and near the top of Mount Everest. In Paris Olympic ambitions for the Seine&rsquo;s are being complicated by bacteria. Far above Earth, the Starliner spacecraft faced a rocky road to the International Space Station (ISS). Starliner&rsquo;s return to Earth is being delayed as Boeing and NASA officials take a look at the leaks and thruster failures that occurred during its journey to the ISS.
