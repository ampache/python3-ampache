    <summary><![CDATA[There are 2 artists with this name:
1) A crust band
2) A hardcore band from Toronto

1) Started as "Hands That Mold" later changed to "Stress Builds Character". We play grindy, sludgy, crusty, melodic, apocalyptic punk with a twist of power violence. We had a few practices, got a new 2nd vocalist (after Teagan left) and recorded our original demo. Joe was one of the lead vocalists for the first 4 shows and original demo until right after the 4th show when he left the band. ]]></summary>
