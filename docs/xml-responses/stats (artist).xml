	<summary><![CDATA[The Hacker is a French electroclash and techno producer who has worked extensively with Miss Kittin.

« L'homme de l'ombre »… From his start in the hardcore technoscene, to the massive success he found with Miss Kittin; Michel Amato aka The Hacker is one of today's most talented and innovative French artists. With influences from Electro (Kraftwerk) to New Wave music (The Cure and Depeche Mode) and familiarity with the French rave scene of the early 1990s his sound is well defined, yet original. ]]></summary>
