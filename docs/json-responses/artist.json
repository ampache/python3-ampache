    "summary": "In The Beginning\n\nHoS is an alternative techno-rock band from Quebec City, Canada. Born out of the ashes of some false start bands of friends and brothers, the first line up of the band got together in 1984 with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Plamondon on vocals, Michel Mercier on drums, Jacques De Varennes of bass, Marl\u00e8ne Sinclair on keyboards and Jean-Pierre Mercier on guitars.\n\nThe band had to create a scene in a city where there was none, renting venues and PAs was the only way to go in their home town as local bars were exclusively booking cover bands.
