Senior news reporter Meghan Bartels took a trip upstate to Cornell University&rsquo;s Teaching Dairy Barn. Early last year Texas dairy farmers noticed lethargic cows producing off-color milk. One of them sent Cornell researchers a sample, which genetic sequencing determined to contain a strain of H5N1. That strain traces its roots to the H5N1 virus that emerged in China in the late 1990s&mdash;which spread around the world thanks to migrating wild birds, such as those found on the beach that associate health and medicine editor Lauren Young visited in episode one of our three-part series about bird flu. And outbreak of H5N1 has been running through poultry farms since the early 2020s. Poultry farmers have been forced to cull flocks, reinforce biosecurity protocols and change the prices of eggs as a result. Dairy farms were less prepared for the spillover and its unexpected transition into raw-milk-drinking barn cats. While pasteurization makes milk safe for human consumption, there&rsquo;s no easy way to prevent the spread between herds of cattle. In the next episode, multimedia intern and producer Naeem Amarsy looks at how the virus made yet another hop&mdash;this time into humans.\n\n\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nHow the U.S. Lost Control of Bird Flu, Setting the Stage for Another Pandemic\n\nhttps:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/bird-flu-has-spread-out-of-control-after-mistakes-by-u-s-government-and\/&nbsp;\n\nBird Flu Vaccine for Cows Passes Early Test\n\nhttps:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/bird-flu-vaccine-for-cows-passes-early-test\/&nbsp;\n\n\n\nE-mail us at sciencequickly@sciam.com if you have any questions, comments or ideas for stories we should cover!\n\nDiscover something new every day: subscribe to Scientific American and sign up for Today in Science, our daily newsletter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScience Quickly is produced by Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Naeem Amarsy and Jeff DelViscio.

There have been few reported cases of human transmission, but the growing risks of H5N1 avian influenza have virologists on alert.\n\n\n\nResearchers at the St. Jude Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response take an annual visit to Delaware Bay to collect samples of bird poop for analysis. These samples give the researchers a look at emerging avian illnesses. While spillover of H5N1 into domestic birds has been known for a while, the first case of spillover into humans was only identified during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. Since then H5N1 has gone global and moved from transmitting from bird to bird to spreading from bird to mammal and from mammal to mammal.\n\n\n\nAssociate health and medicine editor Lauren Young takes a sample collection walk on the beach and speaks with virus detectives about how H5N1 evolved in episode one of our three-part series about bird flu.\n\nJoin us on Wednesday to learn how bird flu jumped from poultry to cattle.\n\n\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nRFK, Jr., Wants to Let Bird Flu Spread on Poultry Farms.

It&#039;s where the magic happens, but it can also be one of the most brutally competitive places a creative person will ever work. We talk to two writer-comedians, Anne Lane and Wayne Federman, about their experiences working in writers&#039; rooms on shows like &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;===&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All original content in &lt;em&gt;Plays Well with Others&lt;\/em&gt; is available under a &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons BY license&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n",
