We talk to two writer-comedians, Anne Lane and Wayne Federman, about their experiences working in writers&#039; rooms on shows like &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;===&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All original content in &lt;em&gt;Plays Well with Others&lt;\/em&gt; is available under a &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons BY license&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n",
