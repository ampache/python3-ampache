    "description": "Protests around the construction of the now complete Dakota Access Pipeline brought national attention to Energy Transfer, the company that built and owns the pipeline and funded private security against the protestors. Energy Transfer sued the nonprofit Greenpeace for hundreds of millions of dollars. The company claimed that the Standing Rock movement was not Indigenous-led environmental activism but a conspiratorial effort by Greenpeace. Reporter Alleen Brown is spending this season of her podcast, Drilled, looking into the lawsuit and the message that legal actions like this send to activists.&nbsp;\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nListen to Drilled\n\nRead Alleen Brown&rsquo;s newsletter\n\nE-mail us at sciencequickly@sciam.com if you have any questions, comments or ideas for stories we should cover!\n\nDiscover something new every day: subscribe to Scientific American and sign up for Today in Science, our daily newsletter.&nbsp;\n\nScience Quickly is produced by Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Naeem Amarsy and Jeff DelViscio.
